# Breast Cancer Classification
This is an end-to-end machine learning classification project that I used for my YouTube course "Machine Learning Projects."  
It demonstrates the following:
- JupyterLab setup
- Data liniage
- Loading data
- Profile reprting
- Data cleansing
- Model prep
- Model testing harness
- Cross validation
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Model export
